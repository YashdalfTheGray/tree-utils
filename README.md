## Development

### Installation

Running an `npm run setup` will install everything that this project needs. This package relies on the fact that `typescript` and `typings` node modules are installed globally. It is also a good idea to have `gulp-cli` globally installed as well.

All of this can be done by running `npm install --global typescript typings gulp-cli`.

### Building

Running either `npm start` or `gulp build` will build the project and put the results in the `dist` folder.

### Testing

Running either `npm test` or `gulp test` will build the project for testing and run the tape tests. The test files are located in the `tmp` folder.
